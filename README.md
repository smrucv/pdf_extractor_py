PDF Extractor using Python and TKinter

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Update 2021-10-12
This App was build according to this two videos from Python Simplified's Channel on YoutTube (https://www.youtube.com/c/PythonSimplified/):

>Parte 1:
>- Script: main.py
>- Video URL: https://youtu.be/itRLRfuL_PQ

>Parte 2:
>- Script: app.py
>- Video URL: https://youtu.be/y8PR4lTAh5E

I had to use the library **_tkmacosx_** because background color changing doesn't work on MacOS.

>Next Steps
>- Refactor de Code: Use OOP to organize the code.
>- Redisign the App: Try to improve UI/UX.

Thank you to Mariya from Python Simplified for the tutorial to learn the basics of TKinter.
